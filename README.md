# Folder structure
Currently all packages with no dependencies lies within the root
directory.

## meta_pkgs
Here I gather groups of packages built together.

# TODO

* Move packages with no deps to pkgs/
* Add tools to:
    * Check for updates
    * Install updates (needs some sort of basic dependency resolution)
    * `makepkg --clean` for all pkgs

Profit?
